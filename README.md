## System Requirements
This is a dockerized project. Any system with **docker** and **docker-compose** installed should be enough.

### Otherwise
You'll need
1. node.js & nvm (currently tested on v14.15.0)
2. angular & angular-cli ( currently tested on v.10)
3. mongodb ( tested with v3.6 and later)

## How to run
1. Clone repository
2. `cd` into it
3. run `docker-compose up` from your system's terminal
4. visit https://localhost on any browser
